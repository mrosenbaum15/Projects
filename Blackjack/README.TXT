USER INSTRUCTIONS:

- After compiling 'Game', please follow the game carefully.
  The scanner will tell you all that you need to do very specifically.
- Do not enter decimals or strings for any question that asks for a value!

House Rules:

1) You can use any number of decks from 1-6.
2) Set any bankroll you want, just not zero.
3) You cannot double down if you bet more than half of your bankroll.
4) Otherwise, if the player doubles down, they will be dealt only one more card,
   and then the dealer will finish its hand.
5) If the player has a hand size of five cards and has not busted, and the dealer
   does not have blackjack, the user has Five Card Charlie and wins the hand.
6) Blackjack pays 3:2.
7) No insurance or splitting.
8) Dealer draws on 16 and stands on all 17's.
9) Beating the dealer pays even money.
10) If dealer and player both get blackjack or have same hand value, it is a push.
11) You cannot place a bet with an odd-numbered value.
12) You cannot place a bet of less than $10.
13) Insurance pays 2:1 and is only offered if the dealer pulls an ace.
